# FoodTracker
I built a FoodTracker app aimed at pregnant women, the idea was to help women track what they were eating and drinking during pregnancy which in turn would help her midwife. I built the app using Andriod Studio. I throughly enjoyed this project and feel like I have started to understand Java and how to develop mobile development.
